she's got a smile that it seems to me 
reminds me of childhood memories 
where everything 
was as fresh as the bright blue sky 
 
now and then when i see her face 
it takes me away to that special place 
and if i stared too long 
i'd probably break down and cry 
 
nice child o mine 
nice love of mine 
 
she's got eyes of the bluest skies 
as if they thought of rain 
i'd hate to look into those eyes 
and see an ounce of pain 
 
her hair reminds me of a warm safe place 
where as a child i'd hide 
and pray for the thunder and the rain 
to quietly pass me by 
 
nice child o mine 
nice love of mine 
 
nice child o mine 
nice love of mine 
 
nice child o mine 
nice love of mine 
 
where do we go 
where do we go now 
where do we go 
 
where do we go 
where do we go 
where do we go now 
 
where do we go 
nice child o mine 
where do we go now 
 
where do we go 
where do we go 
where do we go now 
 
where do we go 
where do we go now 
where do we go 
where do we go now 
 
where do we go 
where do we go now now now now now now now now 
 
nice child nice child o mine
